# Solidity Game - Gatekeeper Attack

_Inspired by OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com), Gatekeeper Two Level_

⚠️Do not try on mainnet!

## Task

This gatekeeper introduces a few new challenges. Register as an entrant to pass this game.

_Hint:_

1. Remember what you've learned from getting past the [first gatekeeper](https://github.com/maAPPsDEV/gatekeeper-attack-one) - the first gate is the same.
2. The `assembly` keyword in the second gate allows a contract to access functionality that is not native to vanilla Solidity. See [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/assembly.html) for more information. The `extcodesize` call in this gate will get the size of a contract's code at a given address - you can learn more about how and when this is set in section 7 of the [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).
3. The `^` character in the third gate is a bitwise operation (XOR), and is used here to apply another common bitwise operation (see [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/miscellaneous.html#cheatsheet)). The Coin Flip level is also a good place to start when approaching this challenge.


## What will you learn?

1. `CODESIZE` vs `EXTCODESIZE`
2. Bitwise Operations

## What is the most difficult challenge?

### Deep dive into "contract creation"

I had tried to do everything in Solidity 0.8.5 at first time, but it didn't work, as it reverted transactions everytime it met underflow.

Finally, I found that Solidity included those checks by defaults while using sliencely more gas.

So, don't you need to use [`SafeMath`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol)?

## Source Code

⚠️This contract contains a bug or risk. Do not use on mainnet!

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {
  mapping(address => uint256) balances;
  uint256 public totalSupply;

  constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}

```

## Configuration

### Install Truffle cli

_Skip if you have already installed._

```
npm install -g truffle
```

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Test and Attack!💥

### Run Tests

```
truffle develop
test
```

You should take ownership of the target contract successfully.

```
truffle(develop)> test
Using network 'develop'.
